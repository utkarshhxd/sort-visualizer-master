This project is a web-based tool to visualize popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. Users can dynamically generate arrays, customize the array size, adjust visualization speed, and watch step-by-step sorting in action. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool provides an interactive way to understand how sorting algorithms work.
